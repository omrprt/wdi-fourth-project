  <a href="#"><img src="./src/assets/images/profileview.png"></a>
  <figcaption>This was the 4th and last project for the Web Development immersive.  Completed in one week after 11 weeks of course work.  I merged my experience as a social worker and web developer. It is a web application for mental health service users to use as a tool to manage their crisis plan.

### Project Brief

Your app must:

* **Use Mongo, Express and Node** to build an API and a **React front-end app** that consumes it
* **Create an API using at least 2 related models**, one of which should be a user
* Include **all major CRUD functions** in a **RESTful API** for at least one of those model
* **API must include tests for the authentication and restful routes
* **Consume your own API** by making your front-end app with **React** using some 3rd party dependencies such as **ui.router** and **ng-resource**
* **Add authentication to your API** to restrict access to appropriate users
* **Craft thoughtful user stories together**, as a team
* Layout and style your front-end with **clean & well-formatted CSS**
* **Deploy your application online** so it's publically accessible
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* **A ``readme.md`` file**

### [](https://github.com/omrprt/wdi-fourth-project#where-next)Where next?

How can the app be extended and improved:

- making some of the schema's editable:
 * currently can't update profile information
 * currenlty can't delete or edit diary or plan entries.
 * currently can't delete or edit support network entries.

- add modals:
 * looking to add more plans, for example a recovery plan.

- Improving the code:
  * I am certain that there are areas of my code to be more efficient and dryer.
  * the code could be refactored further.

- Improve user experience:
  * Futher improve how information is presented in order to have a better user experience.
  * ha a share option with other users.

- Utilize more APIs:
  * have a goole map with markers of where your support networks live.
